Should be able to just run this TheLastArrow.exe on any windows/linux/mac machine.

For the game: Use arrow keys or WASD. Space to shoot arrow. Collect all of the colored gems to unlock the exit. See how long you can last.

I uploaded all of my script files (.cs) to look at. There are some areas of the code that are not touched, like Arrow.cs which I spend a long time trying to utilize but scrapped it for other implementations.
